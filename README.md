Although the game was following a tutorial there are some changes that were made, these are the features:
- 3 HP and 3 Max HP
-  WASD Movement, but also movement with the directional keys like the original
-  Jumping with `W` and `spacebar`
-  Shooting with `Z` and `Left` mouse click
-  Invulnerability, when the player is hit will have 2 seconds of invulnerability
-  Regeneration, if the player HP is lower than the `Max HP` the player will recover 1 HP after 20 seconds
-  Bonuses, the player will get extra lives each N enemies killed, where N increment by 2 each time the bonus is applied, so the first extra lives is at 10 enemies killed, the other after 20, then after 40 and so on.
-  Random enemies, there is a 5% changes a new enemy will spawn randomly
-  After an enemy is killed a new one will spawn randomly
